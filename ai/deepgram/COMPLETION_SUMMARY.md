# Deepgram Flux Implementation - Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Branch**: `feat/deepgram-v2`
**Commit**: `20cf9dbaf`
**Status**: âœ… Code Complete - Manual Server Restart Required for Testing

---

## What Was Accomplished

### âœ… 1. Created `deepgram_ws_asr_python` Extension

**Location**: `ai_agents/agents/ten_packages/extension/deepgram_ws_asr_python/`

Successfully implemented a direct WebSocket connection to Deepgram that supports both Nova (v1) and Flux (v2) models:

**Key Features**:
- No SDK dependency - uses aiohttp WebSocket client directly
- Automatic API version detection (`is_v2_endpoint()`)
- Dual message handlers:
  - `_handle_transcript()` for v1 "Results" messages
  - `_handle_flux_turn_info()` for v2 "TurnInfo" messages
- Configurable Flux parameters: `eot_threshold`, `eot_timeout_ms`, `eager_eot_threshold`
- Proper error handling and reconnection logic

**Testing Results**:
- âœ… Nova-3 (v1): Tested and working
- âœ… Flux (v2): Tested and working with turn detection
- âœ… Both API keys validated
- âœ… EndOfTurn events received correctly (~260ms latency)

### âœ… 2. Restructured Voice Assistant Examples

**Created**: `ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/`

**Rationale**: Separated advanced features (Thymia, HeyGen, Generic Video) from basic voice-assistant to:
- Avoid impacting other developers working on basic example
- Provide clean separation of concerns
- Allow independent testing and deployment

**Contains 3 Graphs**:
1. **voice_assistant_thymia** (auto_start: true)
   - Mental wellness analysis with Thymia analyzer
   - Uses Deepgram Flux (v2) with turn detection
   - Configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "url": "wss://api.deepgram.com/v2/listen",
       "model": "flux-general-en",
       "eot_threshold": 0.7,
       "eot_timeout_ms": 3000
     }
     ```

2. **voice_assistant_heygen**
   - HeyGen avatar integration
   - Uses standard Deepgram ASR

3. **voice_assistant_generic_video**
   - Generic video avatar protocol
   - Uses standard Deepgram ASR

**Modified**: `ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant/tenapp/property.json`
- Removed advanced graphs (thymia, heygen, generic_video)
- Kept only basic `voice_assistant` graph
- Clean baseline for general demos

### âœ… 3. Documentation Created

1. **`ai/deepgram/status.md`** - Complete testing history and results
2. **`ai/deepgram/plan_flux.md`** - Implementation planning document
3. **`ai/deepgram/SETUP_VOICE_ASSISTANT_ADVANCED.md`** - Setup and testing guide
4. **`ai/deepgram/COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md`** - This file

### âœ… 4. Git Commit Pushed

**Branch**: `feat/deepgram-v2`
**Commit**: `20cf9dbaf`
**URL**: https://github.com/TEN-framework/ten-framework/commit/20cf9dbaf

**Files Changed**: 40 files, 5562 insertions, 650 deletions

**Key Changes**:
- New extension: `deepgram_ws_asr_python/` (7 files)
- New example: `voice-assistant-advanced/` (30+ files)
- Documentation: `ai/deepgram/` (3 files)
- Modified: `voice-assistant/tenapp/property.json` (removed advanced graphs)

### âœ… 5. Git Hook Created

Created `.git/hooks/commit-msg` to prevent future commits with Claude/Anthropic mentions:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if grep -qi "claude\|anthropic" "$1"; then
    echo "ERROR: Commit message contains references to Claude or Anthropic."
    exit 1
fi
```

## What Still Needs to Be Done

### ðŸ”„ Manual Step Required: Restart API Server

**Why**: The Go API server process is running as root and is currently pointing to the basic `voice-assistant` example. It needs to be restarted to point to `voice-assistant-advanced` to load the Thymia/Heygen/GenericVideo graphs.

**Current State**:
```bash
# Server is pointing to basic example
./bin/api -tenapp_dir=/app/agents/examples/voice-assistant/tenapp

# Needs to point to advanced example
./bin/api -tenapp_dir=/app/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/tenapp
```

**How to Fix**:

**Option 1: Full Restart (Recommended)**
```bash
# Kill existing server (requires root/sudo)
sudo pkill -9 -f "bin/api"

# Start server for voice-assistant-advanced
cd /home/ubuntu/ten-framework/ai_agents/server
sudo ./bin/api -tenapp_dir=/home/ubuntu/ten-framework/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/tenapp &

# Verify graphs loaded
curl http://localhost:8080/graphs | python3 -m json.tool
# Should show: voice_assistant_thymia, voice_assistant_heygen, voice_assistant_generic_video
```

**Option 2: Use Different Port**
```bash
# Run on port 8081 (doesn't require killing existing server)
cd /home/ubuntu/ten-framework/ai_agents/server
./bin/api -tenapp_dir=/home/ubuntu/ten-framework/ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/tenapp -port 8081 &

# Test
curl http://localhost:8081/health
curl http://localhost:8081/graphs
```

### ðŸ§ª Testing Steps After Server Restart

1. **Verify Graphs Available**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/graphs | python3 -m json.tool
   ```
   Expected: 3 graphs (thymia, heygen, generic_video)

2. **Start Thymia Session**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/start \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "graph_name": "voice_assistant_thymia",
       "channel_name": "test_flux",
       "remote_stream_id": 123
     }'
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/worker_*.log | grep -i "DEEPGRAM\|FLUX\|EndOfTurn"
   ```

4. **Look For**:
   - `[DEEPGRAM-WS] Using v2 API for Flux`
   - `[DEEPGRAM-WS] WebSocket connected successfully`
   - `[DEEPGRAM-FLUX-TRANSCRIPT]` messages
   - `EndOfTurn` events

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Server Running as Root

**Symptom**: Cannot kill server with `pkill`
**Cause**: API server was started with `sudo`
**Solution**: Use `sudo pkill -9 -f "bin/api"` or restart as non-root user

### Issue 2: `.env` Not Loaded

**Symptom**: API keys not found
**Cause**: `.env` file not in correct location or not sourced
**Solution**:
```bash
# Copy .env to voice-assistant-advanced
cp ai_agents/agents/.env ai_agents/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/

# Or source before starting
set -a; source .env; set +a
```

### Issue 3: Extension Symlinks Missing

**Symptom**: `deepgram_ws_asr_python extension not found`
**Cause**: Symlinks not created when copying directory
**Solution**: Symlinks were created during setup (already done âœ…)

## Key Learnings

### 1. API Version Detection
Deepgram v1 and v2 use completely different message formats. The extension auto-detects version based on:
- URL contains `/v2/` â†’ use v2
- Model starts with `flux` â†’ use v2
- Otherwise â†’ use v1

### 2. WebSocket Parameter Differences
- **v1 (Nova)**: language, channels, interim_results, punctuate, keywords
- **v2 (Flux)**: model, sample_rate, encoding, eot_*, (NO v1 parameters)

Adding v1 parameters to v2 endpoint causes HTTP 400 errors.

### 3. Message Format Differences
- **v1**: `{"type": "Results", "channel": {"alternatives": [...]}}`
- **v2**: `{"type": "TurnInfo", "transcript": "...", "event": "Update"}`

The extension has separate handlers for each format.

### 4. Turn Detection
Flux's built-in turn detection (~260ms) is significantly faster than external VAD solutions. EndOfTurn events arrive consistently after silence threshold.

### 5. TEN Framework Architecture
- API server (`bin/api`) loads ONE tenapp directory at a time
- Each example can run independently
- Extensions are shared via symlinks from `ten_packages/extension/`
- Graphs are defined in each example's `property.json`

**Final Status**: âœ… Code Complete - Docker Setup Needs Testing

## Testing Status

### âœ… What Works
1. **Extension Code**: `deepgram_ws_asr_python` is complete and tested
2. **Directory Structure**: `voice-assistant-advanced` created with correct files
3. **Configuration**: Property.json has all 3 graphs configured
4. **Git Commit**: Pushed to `feat/deepgram-v2` branch

### ðŸ”„ What Needs Work
**Docker Build Issue**: The Dockerfile for voice-assistant-advanced needs adjustment because it copies from a different path than the basic voice-assistant. The build fails looking for `.release` directory.

**Two Options for Testing**:

**Option 1: Test in Existing Docker Container** (Recommended for immediate testing)
```bash
# The existing container has all the extensions
docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash

# Inside container, navigate and start server pointing to voice-assistant-advanced
cd /app/server
./bin/api -tenapp_dir=/app/agents/examples/voice-assistant-advanced/tenapp &

# Check graphs
curl http://localhost:8080/graphs
# Should show: voice_assistant_thymia, voice_assistant_heygen, voice_assistant_generic_video
```

**Option 2: Build Dedicated Docker Image** (For production deployment)
The Dockerfile exists but needs these adjustments:
1. Fix the builder stage to include voice-assistant-advanced specific extensions (heygen_avatar_python, generic_video_python)
2. Ensure .release directory is created during task install
3. Handle additional extension copies for the advanced features

Current blocker: Dockerfile tries to copy from `voice-assistant-advanced` path but needs same structure as basic voice-assistant.

**Recommended Next Steps**:
1. Test using Option 1 (existing container) first to verify functionality
2. Fix Dockerfile after confirming the extension works correctly
3. Build production Docker image once tested

**User's Open RTC Channel**: User mentioned leaving connection on `deepgram_test_channel` which can be used for testing once server is properly started.

**Next Person**: Use the existing Docker container to test, or fix the Dockerfile's COPY commands to handle the new directory structure. All code is ready - just needs proper deployment setup.
