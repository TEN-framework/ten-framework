// # Problem
//
// When running tests in parallel, multiple test cases that modify the `HOME`
// environment variable can interfere with each other, causing race conditions
// and intermittent test failures.
//
// The issue occurs because:
// 1. Environment variables are global to the entire process
// 2. Multiple tests running concurrently can overwrite each other's `HOME`
//    settings
// 3. The cleanup code in `Drop` implementations may restore incorrect values
//
// # Solution
//
// A thread-safe solution using a global mutex to serialize access to the `HOME`
// environment variable.

// Use a global mutex to serialize access to HOME environment variable across
// all tests
static HOME_MUTEX: Mutex<()> = Mutex::new(());

/// Helper struct to manage temporary home directory with thread-safe access.
///
/// This struct ensures that when multiple tests run in parallel, they won't
/// interfere with each other's HOME environment variable settings.
/// The mutex ensures exclusive access to the HOME environment variable.
